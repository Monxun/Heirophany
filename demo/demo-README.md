# INTRO //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Name 
- I am a cloud engineer at smoothstack

- My free time is spent hanging out with my 8 year old son Connor or friends and family. Playing guitar and writing music is one of my favorite pastimes

- I have over 15 years of audio engineering and performance experience
- Studied Vocal Performance and Classical composition on a full scholarship in AZ until I realized I'd rather spend time with my new girlfriend than work on being the next Hanz Zimmer or John Williams

- {Coding history}FAST FORWARD ->  Last year, after 12 years in sales, I taught myself Python. 
- This was a game changer from me. 
- Coding became an overnight obsession and I quit sales to study full time.
 
- Immediately I gained an interest in ML, Django, and Containerization for ML pipelines and started competing as a beginner in Kaggle competitions. 

- Since then I've loved every minute of my training in DevOps.
-  The skills we're learning are powerful and extremely fun / cool.
-   Working with teams and providing infrastructure solutions in genomics, neuroscience, and other areas of scientific research would be a dream come true. 

-   My hope for this journey is that I find that I too can make a positive impact on those around me, no matter how small, using these skills to enable others to accomplish they're goals and they're dreams. 

- I may not have the same experience as everyone else but I thrive on being someone who will always find an answer. Blockers are always temporary. 

- I've been through a lot to get here and I am humbled and grateful for the opportunity to learn. 

- And now...
- I'm Gonna Pass it Over to Lynh


# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Let's go over what we've been working on here at smoothstack:

Architecture
Brief overview of your deployment architecture


# DEMO NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

• Wired headset windows 
• setup vnc

- Remote into laptop (Code showed)
- Slides (Create future study slide, Kubeflow cluster, Django + RabbitMQ + Postgres(rds) + Mongo DB(aws) + ArcticDB, financial analysis ml pipeline / signal generation, quant analysis, sidecar app structure(grafana, Prometheus, istio, etc...) + rancher, cluster deployment templates for turnkey cms, crm, merchant systems) 
- Portainer
- Terminal (Workspace)
- Code (Workspace)

App Overview - 30 sec per slide

Prep:
• MAKE SURE ALL FILES ARE OPEN AND IN ORDER
• PLAY MUSIC IN ONE EAR/S
• PRE AUTHENTICATE INTO CLOUD ACCOUNTS
• MAKE SURE SLIDES ARE OPEN IN BROWSER NEXT TO JENKINS/SONARQUBE(PORT FORWARD AND AUTHENTICATE DURING INTROS)

• MAKE SURE TO STAY MUTED!!!!!!

Commands/Actions:

(1 min) Local Development - docker ps, portainer agent, kubectl config get-contexts, Kubectl port forward, k9s

(1 min) Gitflow - git list branches (in aline DevOps dir)
Dev dir run Terraform script

(1 min) CICD Jenkins - port forward  via k9s, look at pipelines

(2 min) Jenkins Pipeline Workflow - show pipeline code(Kubernetes workers, conditionals, and Terraform code (iterating through things, list comprehension, custom modules, Terraform plan)

(2 min) AWS Deployment Overview - access cluster, show services via k9s, review Terraform Deployment(specific resources) and helm charts code(looping through values, toggling resource installations)

(30 sec) Helm Chart Workflow - briefly discuss slide and run commands  

(1.5 min) Future Development - Discuss slide
